# Funebra™ pScreen

**pScreen** is a pixel-screen scanner and perception engine inside the **Funebra™ System**.

It analyzes grids, matrices, screenshots, and rendered visuals as **bn-points**, transforming
visual structure into mathematical, musical, and cognitive data.

---

## ✦ What pScreen does

- Scans **pixel grids / dot matrices / screen captures**
- Converts pixels → **bn-points**
- Extracts:
  - density
  - rhythm
  - symmetry
  - harmonic patterns
- Bridges **vision ⇄ sound ⇄ math**

Pure DOM.  
No plugins.  
No Flash.  
No canvas dependency required.

## ✦ Core concepts

- **bn-points** — atomic Funebra point units
- **Eye logic** — visual perception & geometry
- **Ear logic** — rhythmic & musical interpretation
- **Screen as instrument** — every pixel is data
